# APIs and API Design with Python
5 Day Course
Lecture and Lab
Every course includes the opportunity to earn an API Design with Python certification from Alta3 Research.
Course Overview
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become increasingly important as they provide developers with connectivity to everything from rich datasets in an array of formats (such as JSON) to exposing the configurability of software applications and network appliances. Lessons and labs focus on using Python to interact, design, and build APIs for the purposes of scripting automated solutions to complex tasks. Class is a combination of live demonstrations and hands-on labs.
