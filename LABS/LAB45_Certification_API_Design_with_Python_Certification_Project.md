# API Design with Python - Alta3 Research Certification Project
Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to offer students an opportunity to obtain a Python and RESTful API Certification from Alta3 Research. This certification should work as proof of basic proficiency of Python and RESTful APIs. To earn a certificate, complete the following tasks. Code will be graded on a pass / fail basis within 48 hours of the end of class.

Procedure
Create a public repository on GitHub called alta3research-mycode-cert

Inside of the public repository should be (at least) two (2) scripts. One called, alta3research-flask01.py and a second called alta3research-requests02.py

Your script alta3research-flask01.py should demonstrate proficiency with the flask library. Ensure your application has at least two endpoints. At least one of your endpoints should return legal JSON.

Your script alta3research-requests02.py should demonstrate proficiency with the requests HTTP library. The API you target is up to you, but be sure any data that is returned is "normalized" into a format that is easy for users to understand.

It should be clear how to run your code. If there are any special steps or prerequisites, be sure they are explained in within the script and the README.md within your GitHub repository.

Your code should run without error when executed with Python 3.x

Be sure to observe best practice when writing both scripts. Some things to think about:

Include a shebang
Include documentation at the top
Comment your code so it is clear
Use functions
Your code made span more than a single file
A tool such as pylint may help you write better code
When you finish, email to info@alta3.com containing the following:
